Note that some values that appear “null” indicate that a survey respondent did not select that given option from a multiple-choice list. For example – “Who/what are your favorite media sources that report on data science topics? (Select all that apply) - Selected Choice - Twitter (data science influencers)” For the data cleaning step, handle missing values however you see fit and justify your approach. Provide some insight on why you think the values are missing and how your approach might impact the overall analysis. Suggestions include filling the missing values with a certain value (e.g. mode for categorical data) and completely removing the features with missing values. Secondly, convert 3/6 MIE 1624 Introduction to Data Science and Analytics – Assignment 1 categorical data into numerical data by encoding and explain why you used this particular encoding method.
