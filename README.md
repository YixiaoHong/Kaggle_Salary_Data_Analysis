# Kaggle_Salary_Data_Analysis

In this project I imported a dataset including 19717 samples from  a survey named “2019 Kaggle ML & DS Survey Challenge.” performed by Kaggle. The survey has about 35 questions relating to participants’ age, country, salary and programming experiences. I’m doing this project to build a model to estimate the participant’s salary from the answers they replied to the survey. In this project, I used Pandas dataframe to help clean the dataset suching as droping the rows including missing values or including little information. I used Pyplot tool to help visualize the dataset and make histograms and plots to get an intuitive view of the main trend and structure of the dataset.  I also used sklearn.feature_selection to help select features and usedsklearn.linear_model. LogisticRegression to train and test the model.
