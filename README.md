# Kaggle_Salary_Data_Analysis

In this project I imported a dataset including 19717 samples from  a survey named “2019 Kaggle ML & DS Survey Challenge.” performed by Kaggle. The survey has about 35 questions relating to participants’ age, country, salary and programming experiences. The goal of this project is to build a model to estimate the participant’s salary from the answers they replied to the survey.
